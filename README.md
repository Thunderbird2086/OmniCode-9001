## Overview
OmniCode:9001 is the modular keyboards born in Hong Kong, engineered for control beyond limits. This highly customizable, open-source keyboard is designed for ergonomic comfort, maximum flexibility, and creative power. With magnetic connectors, hot-swappable blocks like GlyphMatrix, PhaseShift, and DeltaForm, OmniCode:9001 adapts to every workflow.  It is built with the RP2040 microcontroller for next-generation performance.  Ideal for makers and keyboard enthusiasts who demand the best.

## Sub Modules
- **Alpha Block:** GlyphMatrix taps into the visual power of language—glyphs as symbols, matrix as command stream. It’s the scriptwriter for your digital world.

- **Nav Block:** PhaseShift suggests rapid movement, shifting through modes or layers like teleportation. It’s your tactical array for traversing digital dimensions.

- **Num Block:** DeltaForm Already perfect. This name suggests modular transformation. Zoom, macros, data entry—all reborn in a shapeshifting format.
